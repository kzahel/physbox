# Project Overview: Physbox

Physbox is a 2D physics sandbox game built with TypeScript and Matter.js. It allows users to place various objects (boxes, balls, walls) and interactive elements (cars, monsters, robots) into a simulated world.

## Vibe Coding History
This project was created using the **Antigravity Preview** entirely through "vibe coding" — meaning no manual code edits were performed by the user. Below is the history of development sessions and their artifacts.

> [!NOTE]
> Artifacts contain creation timestamps. If merging artifacts from other sessions, please use these timestamps to determine the correct chronological order, as the `01`, `02` prefixing may need adjustment.
